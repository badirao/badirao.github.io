        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Adithya Narayan!</h1>
				<p>I am currently a 3rd year undergrad studying computer science. My Research interests include: </p>
					<p style="font-size:30px;">Deep Learning Enabled Video Analytics:-</p>
					<p style="font-size:20px;">My work in this domain is mainly on Classification of Indian Music Videos, where in I leveraged object detection to find Musical Instruments in music videos, that inturn acted as features for a given musical genre(eg: Sitar -> Hindustani, Veena -> Carnatic)</p>
					<p style="font-size:30px;">Computer Vision and Robotics:</p>
					<p style="font-size:20px;">In my Sophomore year, I was part of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle team called Edhitha, where in we built Autonomous Drones capable of simulating Search and Rescue missions. I was part of the Computer Vision and Interoperability subteams, where in my job was to build and test pipelines for Autonomous target detection and classification.</p>
					<p style="font-size:20px;"><a href = "auvsi_suas-2018-journals-ramaiah_institute_of_technology.pdf"> For more info on the specifications of the drone we built, Please take a look at this.</a></p>
					<p style="font-size:30px;">Natural Language Processing</p>
					<p style="font-size:20px;">As of recently, I've begun to work on Code-Mixed Data, especially in the domain of vernacular languages like Hindi and Kannada. To be specific, We are currently focusing on Classification problems that involve the usage of multiple vernacular languages at once.</p>
    				<p>Take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/badirao?tab=repositories">Github</a> to see what i've worked on in the past.</p>
