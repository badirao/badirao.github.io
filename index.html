        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Adithya Narayan!</h1>
				
					<p style="font-size:30px;">I am currently a Software Engineer working at Shell. I graduated from Ramaiah Institute of Technology, with a Bachelor's degree in Information Science and Engineering.</p>
					<p style="font-size:30px;">In the past, I worked at Vahan Inc, a YCombinator funded company in the Conversational AI space, and Stride.AI, a Techstars funded company working in the BFSI space.  </p>
					<p style="font-size:30px;">I was also a part of the 4 man team that represented Ramaiah Institute of Technology in the AUVSI SUAS 2018, in which we placed 10th out of 63 teams. I built and supported the Autonomous Detection Localisation and Classification(ADLC) pipeline, and built scripts to move data between the Data Processing subsystem and the Judge server. I also served as the co-lead of the Sponsorship and Marketing team.</p>

					<p style="font-size:30px;">Take a look at my blog to get a deeper understanding of what I've worked on in the past! Feel free to reach out to me on raoadi[dot]8[at]gmail[dot]com or my Linkedin if you want to communicate!</p>
