        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Adithya Narayan!</h1>
				<p>I am currently a 3rd year undergrad studying computer science. My Research interests include: </p>
					<p style="font-size:20px;">Deep Learning Enabled Video Analytics:-</p>
					<p style="font-size:10px;">My work in this domain is mainly on Classification of Indian Music Videos, where in I leverage object detection to find Musical Instruments, that inturn act as features for a given musical genre(eg: Sitar -> Hindustani, Veena -> Carnatic</p>
					<p style="font-size:20px;">Computer Vision and Robotics:</p>
					<p style="font-size:10px;">In my Sophomore year, I was part of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle team called Edhitha, where in we built Autonomous VTOL's capable of simulating Search and Rescue missions. I was part of the Computer Vision and Interoperability subteams, where my job was to build and test pipelines for Autonomous target detection and classification.</p>
					<p style="font-size:10px;"><a href = "journal.pdf"> For more info on the specifications of the drone we built, Please take a look at this.</a></p>
					<p style="font-size:20px;">Natural Language Processing</p>
					<p style="font-size:10px;">As of recently, I've begun to work on Code-Mixed Data, especially in the domain of vernacular languages like Hindi and Kannada. To be specific, We are currently focusing on Classification problems that invlove the usage of multiple vernacular languages at once.</p>
    				<p>Take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/badirao?tab=repositories">Github</a> to see what i've worked on in the past.</p>
                               

                               <p> Reach out to me on raoadi.8@gmail.com or my Linkedin if you want to communicate!
