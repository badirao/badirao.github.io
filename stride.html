        		<h1>Stride AI</h1>

<p style="font-size:30px;">I interned at Stride AI between June 2018 to August 2018. Stride AI is a Techstars funded company that deals with automating document heavy tasks in the BFSI space.  </p>
<p style="font-size:30px;">Stride.AI is a company that operates in the RPA (Robotic Process Automation)
space, primarily catering to the needs of financial industries like banks and credit
rating agencies.</p>
<p style="font-size:30px;">Robotic Process Automation helps companies from 2 fronts:</p>
<ul>

<li><p style="font-size:30px;">Makes processes simpler, even obsolete through AI/Heuristic driven solutions,
and thereby boost productivity as and when possible.</p></li>
<li><p style="font-size:30px;">Reduce costs in Employment by making manual, repetitive tasks a non human
dependent one.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:30px;">Most of Stride.AI’s automation work flow revolves around the analysis of
Unstructured Financial Documents, usually in the form of a PDF, with the aim of
building SaaS and PaaS solutions for automated data extraction/localization and
NLU(Natural Language Understanding) models/Pattern based heuristics for
Natural Language Querying.</p>
<p style="font-size:30px;">Stride.AI’s primary clients include a multitude of International Banks
headquartered in Brazil, Europe, Bangalore, Japan etc.</p>
<p style="font-size:30px;">Solutions are usually deployed as full stack applications, with an inhouse SDK
used for PDF and Document processing, and trained models for Entity Extraction,
Document Clustering, and Information Extraction.</p>
<p style="font-size:30px;">The company places emphasis on research, especially in the fields of Data Scarce
Natural Language Processing and Document Data Analysis.</p>
<p style="font-size:30px;">I was a part of the Computer Vision team, where my day to day tasks included the development of a scalable, ML based PDF Parsing library component that could be used across all internal projects within the company and building a parsing pipeline to identify key datapoints out of French and Dutch KYC Documents using Tensorflow Object Detection and Tesseract OCR.  </p>
<p style="font-size:30px;">In Short, It was a fantastic experience! I learnt how production ML systems were built and maintained for scalability. I also learnt a lot about how documents are stored and represented in the LInux file system, and how one could mine data out of the same as efficiently as possible.  </p>
<p style="font-size:30px;">As part of my universities internship requirement, I had to write up a research paper regarding the same. It can be found <a href="https://badirao.github.io/int_rep_1MS16IS131.pdf">here</a> </p>
